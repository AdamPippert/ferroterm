# Main Terminal Application PRD

## Overview
The Main Terminal Application is the entry point that orchestrates all Ferroterm components, manages the application lifecycle, window management, and provides the primary event loop for the terminal emulator.

## Dependencies
- TTY Engine (for terminal sessions)
- GPU Renderer (for display output)
- Input/Keymap System (for user input)
- Command Prefix Parser (for AI commands)
- Model Host (for AI processing)
- Streaming UI (for AI responses)
- Config System (for application settings)

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Application Lifecycle
- **FR-1.1**: Initialize all subsystems in dependency order
- **FR-1.2**: Graceful shutdown with resource cleanup
- **FR-1.3**: Handle system signals (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
- **FR-1.4**: Restart subsystems on configuration changes
- **FR-1.5**: Error recovery and component isolation

### 2. Window Management
- **FR-2.1**: Create and manage terminal window
- **FR-2.2**: Handle window resize events
- **FR-2.3**: Support full-screen mode
- **FR-2.4**: Maintain window state across sessions
- **FR-2.5**: Multi-monitor support

### 3. Event Loop
- **FR-3.1**: Main event loop with sub-millisecond latency
- **FR-3.2**: Input event routing to appropriate handlers
- **FR-3.3**: Render frame scheduling
- **FR-3.4**: Async task coordination
- **FR-3.5**: Priority-based event processing

### 4. Component Integration
- **FR-4.1**: Initialize components in correct dependency order
- **FR-4.2**: Route events between components
- **FR-4.3**: Handle component failures gracefully
- **FR-4.4**: Coordinate shutdown sequence
- **FR-4.5**: Manage shared state

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **NFR-1.1**: Application startup time ≤ 100ms
- **NFR-1.2**: Event processing latency ≤ 1ms
- **NFR-1.3**: Render frame scheduling ≤ 16.67ms (60 FPS)
- **NFR-1.4**: Memory usage ≤ 200MB at startup

### Reliability
- **NFR-2.1**: Zero data loss on unexpected shutdown
- **NFR-2.2**: Automatic recovery from component crashes
- **NFR-2.3**: State persistence across restarts
- **NFR-2.4**: 99.9% uptime under normal operation

### Usability
- **NFR-3.1**: Responsive UI under all conditions
- **NFR-3.2**: Clear error reporting and recovery guidance
- **NFR-3.3**: Consistent behavior across platforms

## Pre-conditions
- Operating system with GUI support
- GPU drivers installed
- Configuration files accessible
- Required fonts available
- Network connectivity (for remote models)

## Post-conditions
- All components initialized successfully
- Terminal ready for user input
- Window displayed and responsive
- Event loop running
- Error logging active

## Edge Cases
1. **Component initialization failure**: Retry with fallbacks
2. **Window creation failure**: Fall back to headless mode
3. **GPU unavailable**: Use software renderer
4. **Configuration corruption**: Use defaults with user notification
5. **Memory pressure**: Implement graceful degradation
6. **Network unavailable**: Disable remote model features
7. **Font loading failure**: Use system fallback fonts

## Success Metrics
- Application starts in < 100ms on modern hardware
- Zero crashes in 100 hours of continuous operation
- Event loop maintains < 1ms latency 99% of time
- All components initialize successfully 99.9% of time

## Testing Requirements
1. Component integration tests
2. Startup/shutdown stress tests
3. Event loop performance benchmarks
4. Window management tests across platforms
5. Error recovery scenario tests
6. Memory leak detection over extended runs
7. Multi-component failure simulation
