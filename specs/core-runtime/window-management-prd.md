# Window Management PRD

## Overview
The Window Management component handles terminal window creation, sizing, positioning, and cross-platform window system integration with support for modern desktop features.

## Dependencies
- GPU Renderer (for surface creation)
- Input/Keymap System (for window events)
- Config System (for window preferences)

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Window Lifecycle
- **FR-1.1**: Create native window with terminal dimensions
- **FR-1.2**: Manage window state (minimized, maximized, fullscreen)
- **FR-1.3**: Handle window close events
- **FR-1.4**: Restore window position and size on startup
- **FR-1.5**: Support multiple window instances

### 2. Sizing and Layout
- **FR-2.1**: Character-based window sizing (columns x rows)
- **FR-2.2**: Pixel-perfect font rendering calculations
- **FR-2.3**: Maintain aspect ratio for text grid
- **FR-2.4**: Handle DPI scaling changes
- **FR-2.5**: Support custom window decorations

### 3. Desktop Integration
- **FR-3.1**: System tray integration
- **FR-3.2**: Taskbar/dock integration
- **FR-3.3**: Window manager hints and properties
- **FR-3.4**: Native context menus
- **FR-3.5**: Clipboard integration

### 4. Multi-Monitor Support
- **FR-4.1**: Detect monitor configuration changes
- **FR-4.2**: Handle monitor hot-plug events
- **FR-4.3**: Preserve window position across monitor changes
- **FR-4.4**: DPI-aware positioning
- **FR-4.5**: Fullscreen on specific monitor

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **NFR-1.1**: Window creation time ≤ 50ms
- **NFR-1.2**: Resize event handling ≤ 16ms
- **NFR-1.3**: Smooth window animations at 60 FPS
- **NFR-1.4**: No tearing during resize operations

### Compatibility
- **NFR-2.1**: Support macOS, Linux (X11/Wayland), Windows
- **NFR-2.2**: Work with all major window managers
- **NFR-2.3**: Handle legacy and HiDPI displays
- **NFR-2.4**: Respect system accessibility settings

### Quality
- **NFR-3.1**: Pixel-perfect text alignment
- **NFR-3.2**: Consistent behavior across platforms
- **NFR-3.3**: No visual artifacts during operations

## Pre-conditions
- Display server available
- GPU drivers functional
- Window system permissions granted
- Font metrics calculated

## Post-conditions
- Window created and visible
- Event handlers registered
- Surface ready for rendering
- Window state persisted

## Edge Cases
1. **No display available**: Headless mode support
2. **Monitor disconnection**: Graceful window migration
3. **DPI changes mid-session**: Real-time adaptation
4. **Window manager crashes**: Recovery mechanism
5. **Insufficient graphics memory**: Fallback strategies
6. **Very high DPI displays**: Scaling limits
7. **Multi-GPU systems**: Proper device selection

## Success Metrics
- Window operations complete in < 50ms
- Zero visual artifacts during resize
- 100% compatibility with target platforms
- Window state persistence accuracy > 99%

## Testing Requirements
1. Cross-platform window creation tests
2. DPI scaling validation
3. Multi-monitor scenario tests
4. Window state persistence tests
5. Performance benchmarks for operations
6. Integration tests with window managers
7. Accessibility compliance validation
