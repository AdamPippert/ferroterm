# Response History PRD

## Overview
The Response History component manages persistent storage and retrieval of AI agent interactions, providing search, navigation, and editing capabilities for past conversations.

## Dependencies
- Model Host (for response metadata)
- Streaming UI (for response display)
- Config System (for history settings)
- Profile Cache (for session data)

## Functional Requirements

### 1. History Storage
- **FR-1.1**: Persist all agent interactions with timestamps
- **FR-1.2**: Store prompt, response, and metadata
- **FR-1.3**: Maintain session context and threading
- **FR-1.4**: Support rich formatting preservation
- **FR-1.5**: Implement automatic cleanup policies

### 2. History Navigation
- **FR-2.1**: Arrow key navigation through history
- **FR-2.2**: Jump to specific interaction by index
- **FR-2.3**: Search history by content or date
- **FR-2.4**: Filter by model or session
- **FR-2.5**: Bookmark important interactions

### 3. Response Editing
- **FR-3.1**: Edit previous prompts for regeneration
- **FR-3.2**: Fork conversations from any point
- **FR-3.3**: Delete individual interactions
- **FR-3.4**: Merge or split conversation threads
- **FR-3.5**: Export conversations in multiple formats

### 4. Context Management
- **FR-4.1**: Maintain conversation context across sessions
- **FR-4.2**: Handle context window limits intelligently
- **FR-4.3**: Support manual context selection
- **FR-4.4**: Auto-summarization for long conversations
- **FR-4.5**: Context sharing between models

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **NFR-1.1**: History search results in ≤ 100ms
- **NFR-1.2**: Navigation response time ≤ 50ms
- **NFR-1.3**: Efficient storage with compression
- **NFR-1.4**: Lazy loading for large histories

### Storage
- **NFR-2.1**: SQLite database for structured queries
- **NFR-2.2**: Full-text search indexing
- **NFR-2.3**: Configurable retention policies
- **NFR-2.4**: Backup and sync capabilities

### Privacy
- **NFR-3.1**: Local-only storage by default
- **NFR-3.2**: Optional encryption for sensitive data
- **NFR-3.3**: Secure deletion of history items
- **NFR-3.4**: Export controls for data portability

## Pre-conditions
- Database initialized and accessible
- Storage permissions available
- Search index created
- Configuration loaded

## Post-conditions
- Interaction stored with metadata
- Search index updated
- Context preserved for future use
- Storage quota monitored

## Edge Cases
1. **Database corruption**: Automatic recovery from backups
2. **Storage full**: Intelligent cleanup with user prompts
3. **Very large responses**: Chunked storage and retrieval
4. **Concurrent access**: Transaction isolation
5. **Export large histories**: Streaming export with progress
6. **Search performance**: Query optimization and limits
7. **Context reconstruction**: Handle missing data gracefully

## Success Metrics
- Search accuracy > 95% for relevant queries
- History navigation latency < 50ms
- Zero data loss over 1000 hours
- Storage efficiency > 10:1 compression ratio

## Testing Requirements
1. Large dataset performance tests
2. Concurrent access stress tests
3. Search accuracy validation
4. Export/import roundtrip tests
5. Database recovery scenario tests
6. Context preservation tests
7. Privacy and encryption validation
